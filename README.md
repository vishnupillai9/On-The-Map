# On The Map
On The Map is an iPhone app that lets a user login with their Udacity account and view information posted by other students on a map. The map contains pins for the location where they have reported studying. By tapping a pin, the user can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user can add their own data by posting a string, that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.
